                    Jeremy Lucke currently is enjoying serving as the Pastor at Peace Lutheran Church in Philomath. He
                    enjoys witnessing his members grow in the trust, love, joy and peace that are found in following Jesus
                    Christ. Jeremy also shares his time as the Circuit Visitor for nine Lutheran churches in Linn, Benton and
                    Lincoln countiesâ€”a position designed to assist and encourage pastors and their churches. Prior to
                    serving as the pastor at Peace (beginning in 2013), Jeremy began his pastoral ministry at Grace Lutheran
                    Church in Jacksonville, Florida (2008-2013).
                    The love of his life is his wife, Alicia. They met while participating in a mission trip to Guatemala City in
                    2006 and were then married in 2008. Jeremy says that he won Alicia over with his card playing skills.
                    Alicia says she won him over with her sense of humor. The truth is that they both found a common bond
                    in serving others in the Lord's name. The Luckes have three children. Kaia is 8 years old and the dancer
                    of the family. Claire is 6 years old and lightens everyone up with her joy for life. And Miles is their 14
                    month old that keeps everyone on their toes!
                    Jeremy has experience with Compassion Ministry as Peace Lutheran has hosted seminars for the
                    Philomath community. He deeply connects with Compassion Ministry's goal of stopping the stigma of
                    mental health. It is with joy and great enthusiasm that he joins the Board of Compassion Ministry.
